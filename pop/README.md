# Pop

Simple script to move files to a set directory.
Sometimes you have a bunch of files to move to a specific directory with pop you go to that directory and enter 'pop -s' to set it.
Then I go and find all the files I want to move or copy there and enter pop FILENAME to move it there. 

Take a look at atb to see more functionality.
