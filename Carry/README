Simple bash scrip that allows you to carry multiple files with you to another directory.
To carry a file you enter 'carry FILENAME'. You can continually do this as much as you want.
To drop a file in another directory cd to that directory and enter 'carry -d'. If you'd rather copy the files
there enter 'carry -c'. To see all commands possible just enter 'carry' into the terminal.
